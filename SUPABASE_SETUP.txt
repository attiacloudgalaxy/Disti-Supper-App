Feature: Email Verification Redirect Behavior

When you sign up for an account, you will receive an email confirmation link. Here's what to expect:

What Happens When You Click the Email Link:
- You click the email confirmation link
- You get redirected to localhost (this is normal and expected)
- Your account verification is actually completed successfully
- You need to manually navigate back to this platform to continue with login

Note: The localhost redirect does NOT mean verification failed. Email verification is working correctly.

Demo Credentials for Testing:
You can use these pre-configured accounts to test the application immediately:

1. Admin User:
   - Email: admin@distributorhub.com
   - Password: Admin@2026
   - Role: Full administrative access

2. Partner User:
   - Email: partner@techcorp.com
   - Password: Partner@2026

These accounts are pre-populated with sample data to demonstrate the full functionality of the distributor management platform.
